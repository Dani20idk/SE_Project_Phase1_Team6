5.## Application Specifications:

Architecture:
-The architecture is based on a microservices model, which allows different system components to be created and deployed independently. A microservices design allows  to develop different aspects of the website separately.Microservices integrate each business function (for example, catalog management, product listing, and login/signup capability) as a discrete service. This method makes it easier to change or add new features to the system without affecting other components. In this architecture type, failure in one service does not always affect the entire system.
